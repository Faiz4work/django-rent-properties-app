Script dashboard
http://apps.houzzu.com:5000/

First You need to implement SSL correctly for the script dashboard

then run,you see buttons such as pause restart,are not working on the dashboard.

You need to a do very thorough detailed complete functionality checkup from A to Z
then accurately correctly fix each and any glitch that stops any functionality according to word document manual attached.
